                        he company purchased the McGregor facilities from Beal Aerospace, where it 
                        refitted the largest test stand for Falcon 9 engine testing. <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" class="links" title="Spacex official page">SpaceX</a> has made a number 
                        of improvements to the facility since purchase and has also extended the acreage by purchasing 
                        several pieces of adjacent farmland. As of October 2012, the McGregor facility had seven test 
                        stands that are operated "18 hours a day, six days a week" and is building more test stands 
                        because production is ramping up and the company has a large manifest in the next several 
                        years. In addition to routine testing, Dragon capsules (following recovery after an orbital mission), 
                        are shipped to McGregor for de-fueling, cleanup, and refurbishment for reuse in future missions.

                        <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" class="links" title="Spacex official page">SpaceX</a> currently operates three orbital launch sites, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station,
                        Vandenberg Space Force Base, and Kennedy Space Center, with another under construction near
                        Brownsville, Texas. <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" class="links" title="Spacex official page">SpaceX</a> has indicated that they see a niche for each of the four orbital
                        facilities and that they have sufficient launch business to fill each pad. The Vandenberg
                        launch site enables highly inclined orbits (66–145°), while Cape Canaveral enables orbits
                        of medium inclination (28.5–51.6°).[158] Before it was retired, all Falcon 1 launches took
                        place at the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site on Omelek Island.

                    <p>Starlink is a satellite internet constellation operated by <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" class="links" title="Spacex official page">SpaceX</a>. It provides satellite
                        Internet access coverage to 32 countries where its use has been licensed, and aims for
                        global coverage. As of April 2022 Starlink consists of over 2,100 mass-produced small 
                        satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), which communicate with designated ground transceivers.

                        The <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" class="links" title="Spacex official page">SpaceX</a> satellite development facility in Redmond, Washington, houses the Starlink research,

                        build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" class="links" title="Spacex official page">SpaceX</a> in May 2018 to be at least US$10 billion.
                        In February 2017, documents indicated that <a href="https://www.spacex.com/" class="links" title="Spacex official page">SpaceX</a> expects more than $30 billion in revenue by
                        2025 from its satellite constellation, while revenues from its launch business were expected to 
                        reach $5 billion in the same year.
                        
                        On 15 October 2019, the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) submitted
