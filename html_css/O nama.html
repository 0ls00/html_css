                    <p>Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (doing business as SpaceX) is an American aerospace
                        manufacturer, a provider of space transportation services, and a communications corporation
                        headquartered in Hawthorne, California. SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk with the
                        goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. SpaceX 
                        manufactures the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles, several rocket engines, Cargo Dragon,
                        crew spacecraft, and Starlink communications satellites.

                        SpaceX's achievements include the first privately funded liquid-propellant rocket to reach
                        orbit around Earth, the first private company to successfully launch, orbit, and recover
                        a spacecraft, the first private company to send a spacecraft to the International Space Station,
                        the first vertical take-off and vertical propulsive landing for an orbital rocket, the first
                        reuse of an orbital rocket, and the first private company to send astronauts to orbit and to
                        the International Space Station. SpaceX has flown the Falcon 9 series of rockets over one hundred
                        times.

                        <h3>2001–2004: Founding</h3>
                        <p>
                            In 2001, Elon Musk conceptualized Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature experimental
                            greenhouse and grow plants on Mars, in an attempt to revive public interest in space
                            exploration. Musk traveled to Moscow, Russia with Mike Griffin and tried to purchase
                            cheap and refurbished Dnepr rockets but returned empty-handed after failing to find
                            rockets for an affordable price. On the flight home Musk realized that he could
                            start a company to build the affordable rockets he needed instead. By applying
                            vertical integration, using cheap commercial off-the-shelf components when possible,
                            and adopting the modular approach of modern software engineering, Musk believed
                            SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.

                        <h3>2005–2009: Falcon 1 and first orbital launches</h3>
                        <p>
                            SpaceX developed its first orbital launch vehicle, the Falcon 1, with private funding.
                            The Falcon 1 was an expendable two-stage-to-orbit small-lift launch vehicle. 
                            The total development cost of Falcon 1 was approximately US$90 million to US$100 million.


                            In 2005, SpaceX announced plans to pursue a human-rated commercial space program through 
                            the end of the decade, a program that would later become the Dragon spacecraft. In 2006,
                            the company was selected by NASA to provide crew and cargo resupply demonstration contracts
                            to the ISS under the COTS program.
                            
                            The first two Falcon 1 launches were purchased by the United States Department of Defense under
                            a program that evaluates new US launch vehicles suitable for use by DARPA. The first
                            three launches of the rocket, between 2006 and 2008, all resulted in failures, which almost
                            ended the company. Financing for Tesla Motors had failed as well, and consequently Tesla,
                            SolarCity, and Musk personally were all nearly bankrupt at the same time. Musk was reportedly
                             "waking from nightmares, screaming and in physical pain" because of the stress.
                            </p>

                        <h3>2010–2012: Falcon 9, Dragon, and NASA contracts</h3>
                        <p>
                            SpaceX originally intended to follow its light Falcon 1 launch vehicle
                            with an intermediate capacity vehicle, the Falcon 5. The company
                            instead decided in 2005 to proceed with the development of the Falcon 9, 
                            a reusable heavier lift vehicle. Development of the Falcon 9 was accelerated
                            by NASA, which committed to purchase several commercial flights if specific 
                            capabilities were demonstrated. This started with seed money from the Commercial
                            Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program in 2006. The overall
                            contract award was US$278 million to provide development funding for the Dragon
                            spacecraft, Falcon 9, and demonstration launches of Falcon 9 with Dragon. As
                            part of this contract, the Falcon 9 launched for the first time in June 2010 with
                            the Dragon Spacecraft Qualification Unit, using a mockup of the Dragon spacecraft.

                            The first operational Dragon spacecraft was launched in December 2010 aboard COTS Demo
                            Flight 1, the Falcon 9's second flight, and safely returned to Earth after two orbits,
                            completing all its mission objectives. By December 2010, the SpaceX production line
                            was manufacturing one Falcon 9 and Dragon every three months.

                        <h3>2013–2015: Commercial launches and rapid growth</h3>
                        <p>
                            SpaceX launched the first commercial mission for a private customer in 2013. In 2014,
                            SpaceX won nine contracts out of the 20 that were openly competed worldwide. That
                            year Arianespace requested that European governments provide additional subsidies to
                            face the competition from SpaceX.Beginning in 2014, SpaceX capabilities and
                            pricing also began to affect the market for launch of U.S. military payloads, which
                            for nearly a decade was dominated by the large U.S. launch provider United Launch 
                            Alliance (ULA). The monopoly had allowed launch costs by the U.S. provider to rise
                            to over US$400 million over the years. In September 2014, NASA awarded SpaceX the
                            Commercial Crew Transportation Capability (CCtCap) contract to finalize the development
                            of the Crew Transportation System. The contract included several technical and
                            certification milestones, an uncrewed flight test, a crewed flight test, and six
                            operational missions after certification.

                        <h3>2015–2017: Reusability milestones</h3>
                        <p>
                            SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage in December
                            2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20. In April 2016, the company achieved the first successful
                            landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS) Of Course I Still Love You in the 
                            Atlantic Ocean. By October 2016, following the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they
                            were offering their customers a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused
                            Falcon 9 first stage.

                            A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016, when a Falcon 9 exploded during a
                            propellant fill operation for a standard pre-launch static fire test. The payload, the Amos-6 
                            communications satellite valued at US$200 million, was destroyed. The explosion was caused 
                            by the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified and ignited
                            with carbon composite helium vessels. Though not considered an unsuccessful flight, the rocket 
                            explosion sent the company into a four-month launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. 
                            SpaceX returned to flight in January 2017.

                            Later that year, in March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10 satellite.
                            This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket went back to space.
                            The first stage was recovered again, also making it the first landing of a reused orbital 
                            class rocket.

                        <h3>2017–2018: Leading global commercial launch provider</h3>
                        <p>In July 2017, the company raised US$350 million for a valuation of US$21 billion.[62] In 2017,
                            SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch contracts.[63] By March
                            2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest representing about US$12 billion in 
                            contract revenue.[64] The contracts included both commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers.[65] This made SpaceX the leading global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.[66]

                            In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company,[67] and began work to construct 
                            a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX headquarters and manufacturing facility,
                            utilizing a small number of SpaceX employees,[68] which was completed in May 2018,[69] and 
                            opened to the public in December 2018.[70] During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into
                            a separate corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10% to early 
                            employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.[70]</p>

                        <h3>2019–present: Starship, Starlink, and first crewed launches</h3>
                        <p>
                            In January 2019 SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce in order to help
                            finance the Starship and Starlink projects. Construction of initial prototypes and
                            tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas. All Starship construction
                            and testing moved to the new SpaceX South Texas launch site later that year. In May 2019
                            SpaceX also launched the first large batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning the deployment
                            of what would become the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.
                            The company raised a total of US$1.33 billion of capital across three funding rounds in 2019.
                            By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to US$33.3 billion and reached US$36 billion
                            by March 2020.

                            A major milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched two NASA
                            astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken) into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during 
                            Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX the first private company to send astronauts to the
                            International Space Station and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American 
                            soil in 9 years. The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex
                            39A (LC-39A) of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
